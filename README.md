# White_dwarf
White dwarf search model

searching_WD.py is the white dwarf search code, which may require the installation of the appropriate package (available through conda). After setting the input data path and output data path, the white dwarf search can be performed by selecting the classification model.
transfer.py is the transfer learning code, which can be used to modify the model.

New models will be updated in the future.
